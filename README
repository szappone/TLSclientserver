Part 1
We added in steps 1-4 and wrapped the TCP socket with the SSL/TLS context. We used argparse to
run the client in accordance with the flag options passed in. It works exactly as expected.

Part 2
We added in the elements needed to support SSL/TLS by generating a self signed certificate and
disabled certificate validation to test it against our client. It works as expected.

Part 3
This was simple: we had to convert the certificate from DER to PEM and print the tuple to the
commandline. For example:
	run:
	python tls_client.py --tlsv1.1 --cacert server.crt 127.0.0.1 12345 server.key
	output:
	getting cert
	[('C', 'US'), ('ST', 'Maryland'), ('L', 'Baltimore'), ('O', 'Sarah and Neil'), ('OU', 'Ballers'), ('CN', 'Bosses'), ('emailAddress', 'networkshackers@gmail.com')]
